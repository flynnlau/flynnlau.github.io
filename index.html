  <h1> Lauren Flynn </h1>
  <h2> 2528 E 22nd Street, Minneapolis, MN </h2>
  <h3> flynnlau@gmail.com </h3>
   <div>
    <p> Lauren Flynn is an artist based in the Twin Cities. 
      She studied math and studio art at Grinnell College, 
      and this duality continues to inform her work and thoughts. 
      She recently completed her MFA 
      in sculpture and ceramics at the University of Minnesota. 
     Flynn’s work comes about through the creation of structures 
      which make room for and are transformed by play and coincidence. 
      She sometimes sees her art practice as an ongoing attempt to 
      become gentler and closer to the floor. Flynn is a co-director 
      of Yeah Maybe Gallery in Minneapolis, collaborator of Andy 
      Delany and mother of Alys Delany.
